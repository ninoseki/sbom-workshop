## What is OSV?

> There are many problems to solve industry-wide concerning vulnerability detection, tracking, and response. One low-level problem is that there are many databases and no standard interchange format. A client that wants to aggregate information from multiple databases must handle each database completely separately. Databases that want to exchange information with each other must also each have their own parser for each format. Systematic tracking of dependencies and collaboration between vulnerability database efforts is hampered by not having a common interchange format.
>
> This document defines a draft of a standard interchange format. We hope to define a format that all vulnerability databases can export, to make it easier for users, security researchers, and any other efforts to consume all available databases. Use of this format would also make it easier for the databases themselves to share or cross-check information.
>
> This shared interchange format is not expected to be the internal format for any particular database. We hope only that every vulnerability database will make its entries available in this format to enable interoperability.

## How to use OSV for vulnerability classification

`affected` has a list of combinations of `package`, `ranges` and `versions`.

> Within each object in the `affected` array, the package field identifies the `package` containing the vulnerability. In most cases, there should be exactly one entry in the `affected` array per affected `package` to describe all affected versions. In rare cases, for example if the `ecosystem_specific` encodes platform information that doesn’t apply equally to all listed versions and ranges, a separate entry with the same `package` in the `affected` array may be needed.
>
> The `versions` field can enumerate a specific set of affected versions, and the `ranges` field can list ranges of affected versions, under a given defined ordering. A version is considered affected if it lies within any one of the ranges or is listed in the versions list.

### Package field

`package` field is for identifying the affected package.

```json
{
  "package": {
    "name": "jinja2",
    "ecosystem": "PyPI",
    "purl": "pkg:pypi/jinja2"
  }
}
```

### Ranges field

`ranges` field is for identifying the affected versions.

```json
"ranges": [
  {
    "type": "SEMVER",
    "events": [
      {
        "introduced": "0"
      },
      {
        "fixed": "2.10.1"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The above range means that the versions < 2.10.1 are in the range.

> **Note**
>
> `introduced`'s `0` is a special value and it represents a version that sorts before any other version

## What is osv.dev?

> osv.dev is a vulnerability database and triage infrastructure for open source projects aimed at helping both open source maintainers and consumers of open source.
>
> --- https://github.com/google/osv.dev

- https://osv.dev/
- https://api.osv.dev/

### API usages

```bash
# get a vulnerability
http https://api.osv.dev/v1/vulns/GHSA-462w-v97r-4m45
```

```bash
# query by package URL
http https://api.osv.dev/v1/query package[purl]=pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@2.14.1 | jq ".vulns[] | {id, aliases}"
# which equals to
http https://api.osv.dev/v1/query package[ecosystem]=Maven package[name]=org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core package[version]=2.14.1 | jq ".vulns[] | {id, aliases}"
```

See https://osv.dev/docs/ for more details.

## OSV databases

- [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/github/advisory-database)
- [PyPI Advisory Database](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database)
- [Go Vulnerability Database](https://github.com/golang/vulndb)
- [Rust Advisory Database](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db)
- [Global Security Database](https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-database)
- [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz-vulns)

or

- `https://osv-vulnerabilities.storage.googleapis.com/{ecosystem}/all.zip` (e.g. https://osv-vulnerabilities.storage.googleapis.com/npm/all.zip)

The later one is provided by osv.dev. The data are aggregated from advisory databases and enriched. Also they are packaged per ecosystem.

For example, https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-462w-v97r-4m45 has `versions` but [the original definition](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2019/04/GHSA-462w-v97r-4m45/GHSA-462w-v97r-4m45.json) does not have `versions`.
`versions` are enriched by osv.dev by using PyPI API.

## Real world use cases

### GitHub

GitHub Advisory is powered by OSV.

> Security advisories are published as JSON files in the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) format. For more information about the OSV format, see "Open Source Vulnerability format."

### Note: osv.dev SLA

> OSV strives to provide reliable vulnerability information to our users. To support that goal, target the following service level objectives:
>
> Availability, website and API: 99.9% measured on a 7 day rolling window.
> Latency, website and API: P50 ≤ 300ms, P90 ≤ 500ms, P95 ≤ 1s, that is 50% of requests will be faster than 300ms, 90% of requests will be faster than 500ms, and 95% of requests will be faster than 1s.
> Data Freshness: Data sources no more than 15 minutes stale, 99.5% of the time.
